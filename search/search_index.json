After defining (in a Google sheet) the important DataCite attributes to include in the specification, these attributes were encoded as a JSON-LD specification using the CEDAR Workbench . The JSON-LD specification is the document we call the RADx Metadata Specification. It uses a schema format called the CEDAR Template Model, which is designed so that individual metadata descriptions (the metadata files provided by the RADx (C)DCCs to the Data Hub) contain well-defined values. With this approach, the RADx metadata will conform to a well-described JSON-LD syntax and can be validated easily at any time. For this release of the RADx Metadata Specification, we adopted much of the DataCite specification, following a pattern previously set by another community that created a Generic Dataset Metadata Template in CEDAR. We then added several sections of metadata that allowed more detailed provenance descriptions of the data, and adjusted many of the field descriptions so RADx users could better understand what was expected. Finally, we wrote software to convert our Google Sheet metadata specification into a CEDAR Template in the CEDAR Template Model format, and wrote GitHub Actions to convert the content of the spreadsheet into the specification documentation provided at this Web site. We verified its operation by filling out working metadata examples. The verified template from CEDAR is submitted to the Metadata Specification Repository in GitHub, allowing us to keep track of the versions and compare older versions as needed.","title":"About"},{"location":"about/#about","text":"","title":"About"},{"location":"about/#development-of-the-metadata-specification","text":"The RADx Metadata Specification adopts a widely used community standard (DataCite 3.4) for describing data files.

In some cases the RADx Data Hub support team may be able to help you perform these operations, please contact us at the RADx Support contact address. While many of the artifacts (or examples of them) mentioned in this section can be found in the RADx metadata-specification GitHub repository, their primary location for easy viewing is in the CEDAR repository. You can find the latest links in the README file of the GitHub repository. Detailed explanations of CEDAR operations described in this manual are described in the CEDAR User's Guide. RADx Metadata Specification Template The RADx Metadata Specification Template specifies the metadata format to describe data files or other digital objects submitted to the RADx Data Hub. You can create metadata that conforms to this specification in several ways, as described in the next section. Because the RADx Metadata Specification Template is a JSON Schema, it can be used to validate the Metadata Instances described in the next section. There are online tools as well as software libraries that can be used to perform this validation. The validation only addresses the syntactic organization of the Metadata Instance, it does not check to see if the contents of metadata fields are meaningful. RADx Metadata Instances: Creating Metadata Descriptions We use the term Metadata Instance to refer to a JSON-LD file that conforms to the RADx Metadata Specification template. There are several ways you may want to create a Metadata Instance. Creating a Metadata Instance by Hand (CEDAR) The simplest way to create a valid metadata Instance is to find the Metadata Specification Template, click on the metadata tag or the drop-down menu item 'Populate', and fill out the resulting form and save it. You can view the result while the Metadata Editor is open by using the JSON-LD button at the bottom of the screen, and copy and paste the revealed text document to a text file for viewing. Creating a Reusable Metadata Instance (CEDAR) In another scenario, you may want to partially fill out a Metadata Instance with information that will be the same in many other Metadata Instances. Then that Instance can be used as a 'prefilled with defaults' document from which others can create their own documents. To do this, manually create the Metadata Instance that will contain the shared 'default' data. To let others copy it, make it read-only accessible to their accounts using the drop-down 'Share' menu. (You can specify the name of their account, or you can give the group 'Everybody' read permission.) If you give them the name of the document, they can search for it, and use the drop-down menu in the file viewer dashboard to make a copy of it in their own directory. They can edit their copy (which will include the values you have already set) to produce a new Metadata Instance. Automatically Generating a Metadata Instance (external) The rigorous way to create a CEDAR Metadata Instance is to understand the content in the CEDAR Template, Element, and Field Instances guidance. This is an important reference but there is a significant shortcut available. The easiest way to generate Metadata Instances computationally is to start by creating an example Metadata Instance that has all the metadata fields filled out that you care about. Use recognizable dummy values (e.g., 'zzzz' for text, '9999' for numbers) that you can search for later. Save your Metadata Instance and transfer the saved text into a text editor. Now you can search for all your dummy entries, to see the exact section of the document you need to replace with your own values. You could imagine a gigantic print statement in your source code to print the document all at once, or separate print statements for each variable of interest. While the order of items at the same level does not matter, the JSON nesting must be preserved. You have a choice when it comes to filling out the @id for the document (usually near the top) and the metadata parameters about the document (when it was created or update, by whom, etc.). You either have to set those to 'null', as suggested here, and leave them unfilled; or alternatively, you can use the CEDAR REST API to submit your Metadata Instance and turn it into a fully described CEDAR Metadata Instance document. (The API returns the identifier of the Instance, which you can use to retrieve it.) Eventually we may make this last step an automated part of the RADx ingest pipeline; in the meantime, performing some submissions of your content to CEDAR can help you verify that you are correctly completing a well-formed Metadata Instance. It is also possible to validate a Metadata Instance against the Metadata Specification Template, as described earlier.

This page describes the terminology that we use when talking about a template. Terminology Instances A metadata instance is a document that specifies some specific metadata for some specific data. For example, given a data file, the metadata for the file may describe the file creation date and the name of the person that created the file. Metadata instances are represented using JSON documents, or more specifically JSON-LD (JSON for Linked Data) documents. A portion of a metadata instances that describes the creation of a file is shown below. You should not worry about understanding the formatting or meaning of this snippet at this stage. This metadata specifies that the file was created on October 10, 2022 at 16:44:03 (4:44pm) GMT, it specifies the identifer for the person who created the file as https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1825-0097 and the name of the person who created the file as \"Josiah Carberry\". In this case, the identifier for the person is an ORCID . \"Creation Date\" { \"@value\" : \"2022-10-10T16:44:03.195Z\" }, \"Creator Identifier\" { \"@id\" : \"https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1825-0097\" }, \"Creator Name\": { \"@value\": \"Josiah Carberry\" } Templates A metadata template is a schema for metadata instances. Following on from the example above, a metadata template would specify that the \"Creation Date\" is a date/time, that the \"Creator Identifier\" field is a string that represents an Internationalized Resource Identifier (IRI), and that the \"Creator Name\" field is a string. At their core metadata templates are specified as JSON-Schema. They do however also contain other details, for example information that can be used to generate user-interfaces for metadata instance collection. Like metadata instances, templates contain JSON Linked Data (JSON-LD) markup that is used to embed semantic information into the template that precisely specifies the meaning of \"Creation Date\", \"Creator Identifier\" and \"Creator Name\". This JSON-LD markup is most visible as @context objects that are spread throughout a template. An example of the template description of the \"Creator Identifier\" field that was used in the metadata instance description is shown below. As can be seen, the JSON-Schema/JSON-LD representation of metadata templates is quite verbose and considerably more complex and intimidating that the simple representation of metadata instances. We only provide this example here so you can seen what a fragment of a template looks like. \"Creator Identifier\": { \"@type\": \"https://schema.metadatacenter.org/core/TemplateField\", \"@id\": \"https://repo.metadatacenter.org/template-fields/f88856cc-5b85-444a-bbd1-7d56ff71ed34\", \"schema:identifier\": \"creator_identifier\", \"schema:name\": \"Creator Identifier\", \"schema:description\": \"Globally unique string that identifies the creator (an individual or legal entity).\", \"pav:derivedFrom\": \"\", \"skos:prefLabel\": \"Creator Identifier\", \"skos:altLabel\": [], \"pav:version\": \"0.9.1\", \"bibo:status\": \"bibo:draft\", \"_valueConstraints\": { \"defaultValue\": \"\", \"requiredValue\": false, \"multipleChoice\": false }, \"_ui\": { \"inputType\": \"textfield\" }, \"pav:createdOn\": null, \"pav:createdBy\": null, \"pav:lastUpdatedOn\": null, \"oslc:modifiedBy\": null, \"type\": \"object\", \"title\": \"Field(Creator Identifier)\", \"description\": \"Generated by CSV2CEDAR.\", \"properties\": { \"@type\": { \"oneOf\": [ { \"type\": \"string\", \"format\": \"uri\" }, { \"type\": \"array\", \"minItems\": 1, \"items\": { \"type\": \"string\", \"format\": \"uri\" }, \"uniqueItems\": true } ] }, \"@value\": { \"type\": [ \"string\", \"null\" ] }, \"rdfs:label\": { \"type\": [ \"string\", \"null\" ] } }, \"additionalProperties\": false, \"schema:schemaVersion\": \"1.6.0\", \"@context\": { \"xsd\": \"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#\", \"pav\": \"http://purl.org/pav/\", \"bibo\": \"http://purl.org/ontology/bibo/\", \"oslc\": \"http://open-services.net/ns/core#\", \"schema\": \"http://schema.org/\", \"skos\": \"http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#\", \"schema:name\": { \"@type\": \"xsd:string\" }, \"schema:description\": { \"@type\": \"xsd:string\" }, \"skos:prefLabel\": { \"@type\": \"xsd:string\" }, \"skos:altLabel\": { \"@type\": \"xsd:string\" }, \"pav:createdOn\": { \"@type\": \"xsd:dateTime\" }, \"pav:createdBy\": { \"@type\": \"@id\" }, \"pav:lastUpdatedOn\": { \"@type\": \"xsd:dateTime\" }, \"oslc:modifiedBy\": { \"@type\": \"@id\" } }, \"$schema\": \"http://json-schema.org/draft-04/schema#\" } Fields A field is the most basic descriptive unit of a metadata template. The key aspects of a field are that is has a name (for example \"Creator Identifier\"), a description (or help text). Fields are either directly or indirectly embedded into template to form a complate metadata description. Elements An element is an ordered collection of fields and other nested elements. For example, we may have a \"Creator\" element that comprises the \"Creator Identifier\", \"First Name\" and \"Last Name\" fields. Like fields, elements have a name and a description, amongst other attributes. The artifacts contained in an element may have multiplicities assigned to them. Thus, we can say that a field in an element is required (min 1) and/or single valued (max 1). Technologies Template, fields and elements make heavy use of JSON-Schema and JSON for Linking Data (JSON-LD) . We provide a very brief summary of these technlogies here. For more detailed information on these technologies please see the linked Web sites. JSON-Schema Like XML Schema for XML documents, JSON-Schema provides a declarative way of describing JSON documents and a JSON-Schema can be used to validate a JSON document. JSON-LD JSON-LD adds Semantic markup to JSON, making the meaning of JSON documents precise and increasing interoperability across the Web. Indeed, search engines such as Google take advantage of JSON-LD markup to discover the unambiguous meaning of information in JSON documents. For our purposes, JSON-LD aids us in making metadata FAIR \u2013 F indable, A ccessible, I nteroperable and R esuable.","title":"Preliminaries"},{"location":"preliminaries/#preliminaries","text":"The metadata template that is described in these pages is normatively specified using a CEDAR Template.

This field should not be manually specified or edited. The total duration of data temporal coverage, specified in in ISO-8601 duration format. P is the duration designator (for period) placed at the start of the duration representation. - Y is the year designator that follows the value for the number of calendar years. - M is the month designator that follows the value for the number of calendar months. - W is the week designator that follows the value for the number of weeks. - D is the day designator that follows the value for the number of calendar days. T is the time designator that precedes the time components of the representation. - H is the hour designator that follows the value for the number of hours. - M is the minute designator that follows the value for the number of minutes. - S is the second designator that follows the value for the number of seconds. The duration format must begin with P, and include at least one designator and value; other designators may be dropped. The smallest designator may include a decimal fraction. For example, P8DT1.5H indicates a duration of 8 calendar days + 1.5 hours.
