# RADx-DHT Metadata Mapping

This page explains how to take pre-existing RADx-DHT metadata and convert it into RADx Metadata.  

RADx-DHT uses the [Datacite Metadata Schema](https://schema.datacite.org) as its metadata specification.  Fortunately, the RADx Metadata Specification is influenced by Datacite and many fields in the RADx Metadata Template have a one-to-one correspondance with metadata fields in the Datacite metadata schema.
