# Introduction

These pages describe the RADx [Metadata Specification](specification.md).  This metadata specification contains a meta template that specifies required, recommended and optional fields that are used for capturing metadata that described data files submitted to the [RADx Data Hub](https://radx-hub.nih.gov/home).

We recommend that you start by reading the [specification](specification.md).  After this, you can learn about the different ways of [creating metadata](creating-metadata.md) instances that describe individual data files and comply with the specification that is described here.
